PHP
- use bindParam for all sql statements
- (show error when filter is not a valid value), feedback on login as well

idea: user can delete another user, database checks if the logged in user still exists when this happens, also can update data (update and delete). JUST NEED TO DO UPDATE
users can rent a game and those games are no longer displayed (crud functionality to website content) - COMPLETE
